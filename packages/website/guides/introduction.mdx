## Setting up a new project

**Cannon**Â is a DevOps tool for protocols on Ethereum. It manages protocol and smart contract deployments for local development and live networks replacing deploy scripts withÂ [Cannonfiles](https://usecannon.com/learn/cannonfile).

#### Installing Foundry

**Cannon** uses [Foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/) to work. Foundry is a toolchain for developing smart contracts, managing dependencies, compiling the project, running tests, deploying your project, and allowing you to interact with the chain from the Cannon CLI.

On your terminal run:

```bash
curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash
```
This will install **Foundryup**. Simply follow the on-screen instructions, and the `foundryup` command will become available in your CLI.

#### Installing Cannon CLI

Cannonâ€™s **command-line interface** (CLI) allows users to deploy, upgrade, and configure protocols using Cannonfiles with theÂ `build`Â command,Â `publish`Â the resulting packages,Â `run`Â packages locally, and more. Find the code for the CLIÂ [on GitHub](https://github.com/usecannon/cannon/tree/main/packages/cli).

Run one of the following commands in your terminal to install (or upgrade) Cannon:

    ```

Once youâ€™re done, runÂ `cannon --version`Â on a terminal to check your installation.

```bash
$ cannon --version
2.18.0
```
