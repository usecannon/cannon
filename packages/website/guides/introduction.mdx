## Set up your dev environment
**Cannon** is a DevOps tool for protocols on Ethereum. It manages protocol and smart contract deployments for local development and live networks, replacing deploy scripts with [Cannonfiles](https://usecannon.com/learn/cannonfile).

#### Installing Foundry

**Cannon** is built on [Foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/) (and is also compatible with Hardhat).

</Alert>

In your terminal, run

```bash
curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash
```
This installs the `foundryup` command, which can be run again later to upgrade Foundry to its latest version.

#### Installing Cannon CLI

Cannon’s **command-line interface** (CLI) allows users to deploy, upgrade, and configure protocols using Cannonfiles with the `build` command, `publish` the resulting packages, `run` packages locally, and more. Find the code for the CLI [on GitHub](https://github.com/usecannon/cannon/tree/main/packages/cli).

Run one of the following commands in your terminal to install (or upgrade) Cannon:

  <TabsContent value="pnpm">
    ```bash

    ```

Once you’re done, run `cannon --version` on a terminal to check your installation.

```bash
$ cannon --version
2.18.0
```
