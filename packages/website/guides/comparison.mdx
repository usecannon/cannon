## Cannon Compared with...

Cannon is a powerful deployment framework that offers unique advantages over traditional smart contract deployment tools. Let's compare Cannon with other popular deployment solutions to understand why Cannon stands out.

## Comparison Overview

| Feature | Cannon | Foundry Scripts | hardhat-deploy | Hardhat Ignition |
|---------|--------|-----------------|-----------------|------------------|
| **Framework Compatibility** | Universal (Hardhat, Foundry, etc.) | Foundry only | Hardhat only | Hardhat only |
| **Deployment Language** | YAML/JSON | Solidity | JavaScript | TypeScript |
| **Deployment Style** | Declarative | Imperative | Imperative | Declarative |
| **Artifact Distribution** | Onchain packages | Local files | Local files | Local files |
| **Cross-chain Support** | Native | Manual | Manual | Manual |
| **Package Management** | Built-in | None | None | None |
| **State Management** | Immutable, versioned | Manual | Manual | Manual |

## Detailed Comparison

### Framework Compatibility

**Cannon** provides universal compatibility, working seamlessly with both Hardhat and Foundry projects. You can use your existing development environment without switching tools.

**Foundry Scripts** are limited to Foundry projects only, requiring you to use Foundry's testing framework and tooling.

**hardhat-deploy** and **Hardhat Ignition** are exclusive to Hardhat projects, limiting your framework choices.

### Deployment Language

**Cannon** uses declarative TOML configuration files that clearly define your deployment steps, dependencies, and contract interactions. This makes deployments more readable and maintainable.

**Foundry Scripts** use Solidity for deployment logic, which can be powerful but requires more boilerplate code and is less intuitive for complex deployment scenarios.

**hardhat-deploy** and **Hardhat Ignition** use JavaScript/TypeScript, which is familiar to many developers but can become verbose for complex deployments.

### Deployment Style

**Cannon** follows a declarative approach where you specify what you want deployed rather than how to deploy it. This makes deployments more predictable and easier to reason about.

**Foundry Scripts** and **hardhat-deploy** use imperative deployment scripts where you manually control each step, which can lead to inconsistencies and harder debugging.

**Hardhat Ignition** also uses a declarative approach.

### Artifact Distribution

**Cannon** stores all deployment artifacts (addresses, ABIs, configuration) onchain as immutable packages which are rooted on an on-chain manifest, and fetchable on IPFS. Cannon also provides an IPFS service which will automatically pin your artifacts. This ensures:
- No lost deployment data
- Version-controlled deployments
- Easy sharing across teams
- Reproducible deployments

**Foundry Scripts**, **hardhat-deploy**, and **Hardhat Ignition** store artifacts locally and are usually either/both checked into Git, or . Every project has its own structure for distributing or handling these artifacts, and this makes it difficult to share across environments.

### Package Management

**Cannon** includes built-in package management, allowing you to:
- Publish and share deployment packages
- Install and use packages from the registry
- Version control your deployments and track the evolution
- Keep version sources
- Reuse deployment configurations

Other tools rely on other tools like NPM for this functionality.
