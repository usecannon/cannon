## Deploy Onchain

Deploying your Cannon project on a live network is similar to building it locally. The main difference is that you'll use the `build` command with specific flags to target a live blockchain.

### Step 1: Choose a network and RPC URL

To specify the network for deployment, you can use either the `--chain-id` flag or the `--rpc-url` flag.

*   The `--chain-id` flag uses the default RPC URL for the specified chain ID.
*   The `--rpc-url` flag allows you to provide a custom RPC URL. This is generally recommended for better reliability and control.

If both flags are specified at the same time, the given `--rpc-url` is used, and the `--chain-id` is validated to match the response by the RPC server.

For this example, we'll use the Sepolia test network, which is a dedicated network for testing and deploying smart contracts. We'll use a specific RPC URL for Sepolia: `https://rpc2.sepolia.org/`

### Step 2: Provide a private key

You'll need to specify the private key of the wallet you want to use for deployment. You can do this using the `--private-key` flag.

**Important:**

*   **Security:** Be extremely careful when handling private keys. **Never** share your private keys with anyone, and store them securely.
*   **Hardware wallets:** If you're using a hardware wallet or prefer not to expose your private key in plain text, you can use a tool like [Frame](https://frame.sh/). When Frame is running, the Cannon CLI will prompt you to sign transactions through Frame's secure interface.

### Step 3: Perform a dry run

Before deploying on a live network, it's highly recommended to perform a dry run. This simulates the deployment process without actually sending any transactions, allowing you to verify that everything is set up correctly.

To perform a dry run, use the `--dry-run` flag with the `build` command:

```bash
cannon build --rpc-url https://rpc2.sepolia.org --private-key 0xd8...ad --dry-run
```

This command will output the deployment steps, contract addresses, transaction hashes, and gas costs, just like a real deployment, but without actually executing the transactions.

### Step 4: Deploy on Sepolia

Once you've verified your deployment with a dry run, you can proceed with the actual deployment by removing the `--dry-run` flag:

```bash
cannon build --rpc-url https://rpc2.sepolia.org --private-key 0xd8...ad
```

This will deploy your Cannon project on the Sepolia network. The output will look almost the same as the local network build from the previous guide.
