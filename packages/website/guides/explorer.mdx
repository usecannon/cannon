## Using Cannon explorer

Now we can [go to the explorer](https://usecannon.com/packages) and search for the package we just published by its name.

![explorer-search-package](/images/get-started/explorer-1.png)

When we select the package, we'll be able to see that Cannon shows us on which chains it's deployed, which version of the package, and the deployment data. We're going to select the `latest` version which, in this case, matches the other version below.

Once we enter to view the package, we'll be able to see how to run it locally, how to retrieve addresses and ABIs, and how to integrate this package within a Cannonfile.

In addition to this, we will have four sections:

- **Deployment,** where we will be able to see the contract deployments and function calls,

- **Code,** where we will be able to view the contract code and download the ABI,

- **Interact,** one of the great benefits of publishing on Cannon as it allows us to interact with the contract and its functions directly from the website,

- and lastly, **Cannonfile**, where we will be able to view the generated Cannonfile in the form of graphs, lists, or code.

In addition to this, we will have two links where we can retrieve the deployment using the Package URL generated in the publish.

We can also see that the contract was automatically verified by Cannon during the publish process.
