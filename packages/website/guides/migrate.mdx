# Migration Guide

This guide helps you migrate from various deployment tools to Cannon. There are many different deployment tools
which may have been used, but the general steps below can be applied to any of them.

### Migration Steps

1. Recreate the deployment of your project as a Cannonfile. This has to be done manually but is usually a relatively quick process as 
cannon's deployment process is generally quite concise.

2. Build the Cannon package you just created in the directory of the Cannonfile: `cannon build`. This is the local network "template" of your project. At the end, the IPFS hash of your package will be printed. Remember to save this!

Then, for each network that your project is deployed to:

1. Create a package based on the local network template (use the IPFS hash saved from earlier):
```
cannon alter <my-package> --chain-id <chain id> set-url <local network pkg url>
```
2. For each step in your cannon package, import it using the alter import command. 
* If its a deployed contract (deploy step), provide the contract creation transaction hash
* If its a executed transaction (invoke step), provide the transaction hash

3. Run the build for your network to check that everything is healthy. No steps should be executed:
```
cannon build --chain-id <chain id>
```
4. Publish your package to the Cannon registry

```
cannon publish <my-package> --chain-id <chain id>
```

## Example projects that have been ported to Cannon

Our team has converted some popular DeFi projects to Safe for compatibility and testing. These can serve as an 
example of the ideas process described in this guide.

* [Chainlink](https://github.com/usecannon/chainlink)
* [Uniswap V3](https://github.com/usecannon/uniswap-v3)
