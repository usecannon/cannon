## Publish Your Package

After building your cannonfile, you can publish the resulting package to the Cannon. This streamlines version control, allows others to find information about your deployment, and makes it easy for other projects to integrate with your protocol. 

The [Cannon registry](https://usecannon.com/packages/registry/latest/10-main/code/registry?source=contracts%2FCannonRegistry.sol) is a smart contract that keeps a record of the association between the package name and the deployment data.

<Alert variant="warning">
  <AlertDescription>
    By default, Cannon includes the project's source code in the published package. This can be avoided by adding `privateSourceCode = true` to your `cannonfile.toml`.
  </AlertDescription>
</Alert>

To publish our `cannon-learn` package, we can use the command-line interface:

```bash
cannon publish learn-cannon:0.0.1 --chain-id 11155111
```

Here, we specify the package name/version `learn-cannon:0.0.1` and the chain ID `11155111` for Sepolia.

The CLI will prompt you to select which deployment of the registry you want to use. We generally recommend Optimism Mainnet, as it is faster and less expensive than Ethereum Mainnet. You will need some ETH on whichever network you choose.

```bash
? Which registry would you like to use? (Cannon will find the package on either):
❯   OP Mainnet (Chain ID: 10)
    Ethereum Mainnet (Chain ID: 1)
```

After you select a network, it will ask us to enter the private key we want to use.

```bash
? Enter the private key of the address you want to use:
```

If this is the first time you're publishing a version of a package with this name (`cannon-learn`), you will need to register it on mainnet (regardless of the chain you selected).

```bash
Package "learn-cannon" not yet registered, please use "cannon register" to register your package first. You need enough gas on Ethereum Mainnet to register the package on Cannon Registry

? Would you like to register the package now? › (Y/n)
```

Cannon will walk your through the process to register the package. **Note that it can take a few minutes for the package registration to propogate from mainnet to Optimism.**

```bash
You are about to register the following packages:

- Package: learn-cannon

The transaction will cost ~0.001844607656625584 ETH on Ethereum Mainnet.

Once the registration process is complete, you can continue publishing `learn-cannon`.

```bash
We will continue with the publishing process.
