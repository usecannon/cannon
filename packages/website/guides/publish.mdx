## Publish Your Package

Publishing your Cannon package to the Cannon registry makes it easier to manage versions, share your deployment with others, and integrate your protocol with other projects. This guide explains how to publish your package using the Cannon CLI.

### What is the Cannon registry?

The [Cannon registry](https://usecannon.com/packages/registry/latest/10-main/code/registry?source=contracts%2FCannonRegistry.sol) is a smart contract that stores the association between package names and their deployment data. This allows other developers and tools to easily access and utilize your published packages.

    By default, Cannon includes your project's source code in the published package. To prevent this, add `privateSourceCode = true` to your `cannonfile.toml`.

### Step 1: Use the `cannon publish` command

To publish your Cannon package, use the `cannon publish` command followed by the package name and version, and the chain ID where it's deployed:

```bash
cannon publish learn-cannon:0.0.1 --chain-id 11155111
```

This command initializes the process of publishing the `learn-cannon` package, version `0.0.1`, deployed on the Sepolia network (chain ID `11155111`).

### Step 2: Choose a registry

The CLI will prompt you to select the network where you want to publish your package. We generally recommend Optimism Mainnet, as it is faster and less expensive than Ethereum Mainnet. You'll need some ETH on the chosen network to cover transaction fees for the publish. Additionally, if this is the first time that this namespace is being registered, you will need to have some funds on Ethereum Mainnet for the one-time registration fee.

```bash
? Which registry would you like to use? (Cannon will find the package on either):
❯  OP Mainnet (Chain ID: 10)
   Ethereum Mainnet (Chain ID: 1)
```

### Step 3: Provide a private key

Next, you'll be asked to enter the private key of the wallet you want to use for publishing:

```bash
? Enter the private key of the address you want to use:
```

### Step 4: Register your package (if needed)

If this is the first time you're publishing a package with this name (`learn-cannon`), you'll need to register it on the Ethereum Mainnet (regardless of the chain you selected for publishing).

```bash
Package "learn-cannon" not yet registered, please use "cannon register" to register your package first. You need enough gas on Ethereum Mainnet to register the package on Cannon Registry

? Would you like to register the package now? › (Y/n)
```

If you choose to register the package, Cannon will guide you through the process. Note that it can take a few minutes for the package registration to propagate from Mainnet to Optimism.

### Step 5: Confirm publishing details

Once your package is registered, Cannon will display the publishing details, including the estimated fees.

```bash
Settings:
 - Max Fee Per Gas: default
 - Max Priority Fee Per Gas: default
 - Gas Limit: default
 - To alter these settings use the parameters '--max-fee-per-gas', '--max-priority-fee-per-gas', '--gas-limit'.

Publishing with 0x88e224762460f5aAcA3Bde86dA4EFa9B13662b80

This will publish **learn-cannon** to the registry:
 - 0.0.1 (preset: main)
 - latest (preset: main)

Total Publishing Fees: 0.0025 ETH

```

  <AlertDescription>
    An ETH-denominated publishing fee is included in the publish transaction. This fee contributes to the maintenance of the project's IPFS cluster and web hosting.

### Step 6: Wait for indexing

After you confirm, Cannon will publish your package to the registry. This may take a few minutes. Once published, the CLI will provide details about the published package.

```bash
Publishing package...
This may take a few minutes.

Publishing packages to the registry on-chain...

Package: learn-cannon

Gas price: 0.000000006634068496 ETH
Estimated transaction Fee: 0.001081200581272592 ETH

```

After a few minutes, your package will be indexed and visible on the [Cannon explorer](/packages).
