## Create a Project

This guide will walk you through creating your first Cannon project using Foundry. If you're using Hardhat, we will be updating this page shortly with a more detailed guide!

### Step 1: Create a new project directory

1. Open your terminal.
2. Create a new project directory and navigate into it:

   ```bash
   mkdir learn-cannon
   cd learn-cannon
   ```

### Step 2: Initialize a Foundry project

1. Initialize a Foundry project using the following command:

   ```bash
   forge init
   ```

   This command creates the initial project structure for you.

### Step 3: Create a Cannonfile

1. In the root folder (next to the `foundry.toml` file), create a file named `cannonfile.toml`.
2. Add the following content to your `cannonfile.toml`:

   ```toml
   name = 'learn-cannon'
   version = '0.0.1'
   description = 'Cannon learn - Sample Foundry Project'
   ```

   Cannonfiles are like deployment plans for your blockchain application. They include actions that specify the desired state of a blockchain.

### Step 4: Write a smart contract

1. In the `/src` folder, you'll find a contract called `Counter.sol` that Forge created. This is a basic contract with two functions: `setNumber` and `increment`. Feel free to modify it.

   ```solidity
   // ./src/Counter.sol

   // SPDX-License-Identifier: UNLICENSED
   pragma solidity ^0.8.13;

   contract Counter {
       uint256 public number;

       function setNumber(uint256 newNumber) public {
           number = newNumber;
       }

       function increment() public {
           number++;
       }
   }
   ```

### Step 5: Add actions to your Cannonfile

Cannon uses [TOML](https://toml.io/en/) to represent deployment definitions. Cannon can also receive JSON input piped from stdin
(allowing script generators to supply large or more automated configurations). For now, we will create 
a basic Cannonfile to deploy the Counter contract.

1. Edit your `cannonfile.toml` to include the following actions:

   ```toml
   # The top of the file defines basic package information 
   name = "learn-cannon"

   # The version can be any human readable value representative of your project's version. Note that cannon internally tracks the version
   version = "0.0.1"

   # Longer, human readable description of the package
   description = "Sample Cannon + Foundry Project"

   # Each of the square bracketed headers below defines a new section defining a particular resource that should be invoked for the deployment.
   # These can be specified in any order, irrespective of dependencies. Cannon will automatically execute steps in the order that is required to complete the deployment.
   [var.ProtocolSettings]
   number = "420"

   [deploy.Counter]
   artifact = "Counter"

   [invoke.SetNumber]
   target = ["Counter"]
   func = "setNumber"
   args = ["<%= settings.number %>"]
   ```

   Each action in a Cannonfile is identified with a `type` and a `name``, specified like `[type.name]`. Let's break down these actions:

   *   The `[deploy.Counter]` action deploys the `Counter` contract. It reads from the Foundry artifact specified by the `artifact` key and stores the resulting contract address, ABI, transaction hash, and gas usage information in a artifact with the same name as the action. Constructor arguments, solidity libraries, and deployments via `create2` are also supported.
   *   The `[var.ProtocolSettings]` action allows Cannon to add values to the `settings` object, which can be referenced via interpolation (`<% settings.number %>`) in other actions.  Settings can be derived from other settings, fields from deployed contracts, events emitted from previous transactions, or environment factors such as `chainId` or `timestamp`. Here, we define a variable `number` and set it to the string "420".
   *   The `[invoke.SetNumber]` action calls the `setNumber` function on the previously deployed `Counter` contract with the argument `420` (from `settings.number`). Similar to `deploy`, `invoke` actions support a number of additional features and capabilities which can be read in the docs.

  Actions can be specified in any order (cannon automatically determines which actions are dependant on other actions). They can also be stored in separate TOML files and pulled in using the `include` header.

   There are more action types to handle more advanced cases than what is shown here. You can find a full list of actions that can be specified in a Cannonfile in [the docs](/learn/cannonfile).
