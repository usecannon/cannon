## Creating a project

To start a new project, create a directory for it:

<Snippet>
  <span class="text-blue-400">$</span> mkdir learn-cannon
  <span class="text-yellow-400">&&</span> cd learn-cannon
</Snippet>

Once inside the folder, initialize the project running `forge init`

<Snippet>
  <span class="text-blue-400">$</span> forge init
</Snippet>

Forge will create the initial project structure for us. The result will be as follows:

<Snippet>
  // TODO: Change this component for file tree component
  [https://magicui.design/docs/components/file-tree](https://magicui.design/docs/components/file-tree)
  <p class="text-red-400">.</p>

    📢 In this guide, we will not delve into the use of Forge, for more
    information about what can you do visit [**Foundry
    documentation**](https://book.getfoundry.sh/config/).

<br />
#### Installing Foundry

At the root folder create your first `cannonfile.toml`.

<Snippet>
  <p class="text-gray-400">// ./cannonfile.toml</p>
  name = <span class="text-yellow-400">'learn-cannon'</span> <br />
  version = <span class="text-yellow-400">'0.0.1'</span> <br />
  description = <span class="text-yellow-400">'Cannon learn - Sample Foundry Project'</span> <br />
</Snippet>

Cannonfiles are like deployment plans. They include operations that specify
the desired state of a blockchain.

You can use the CLI and our web app to `build` the blockchain into this state.
This results in a package of data pertaining to the deployment, which
can be uploaded using IPFS and published to the registry on Ethereum.

<br />
#### Create a contract

In the `/src` folder, Forge will have created the contract called `Counter.sol`.
A basic contract with two functions: `setNumber` and `increment`.

<Alert variant="warning">
  <AlertDescription>
    ⚠️ In this guide, we won't dive deep into creating and structuring smart
    contracts. These are simply example cases to get started with Cannon.

<Snippet>
  ```js
 // ./src/Counter.sol

// SPDX-License-Identifier: UNLICENSED
pragma solidity ^0.8.13;

contract Counter {
uint256 public number;

    function setNumber(uint256 newNumber) public {
        number = newNumber;
    }

    function increment() public {
        number++;
    }

}
```
</Snippet>

#### Adding steps on the cannonfile

Edit your `cannonfile.toml` with the following steps.

<Snippet>
 <p class="text-gray-400">// ./cannonfile.toml</p> <br />
 name = <span class="text-yellow-400">'learn-cannon'</span> <br />
 version = <span class="text-yellow-400">'0.0.1'</span> <br />
 description = <span class="text-yellow-400">'Cannon learn - Sample Foundry Project'</span><br /><br />
 [deploy.counter]<br />
 artifact = <span class="text-yellow-400">'Counter'</span><br /><br />
 [deploy.counter]<br />
 number = <span class="text-yellow-400">'420'</span><br /><br />
 [invoke.set_number]<br />
 target = [<span class="text-yellow-400">"counter"</span>]<br />
 func = <span class="text-yellow-400">"setNumber"</span><br />
 args = [<span class="text-yellow-400">`"<%= settings.number %>"`</span>]
</Snippet>

Each step in a cannonfile is composed by a type and a name resulting
in `[type.name]`, the step name is only referential, made to improve
the user experience.  In this** **example we will be covering the `[deploy.counter]`,
`[var.main]` and the `[invoke.set_number]` steps.

The `[deploy.counter]` step is used to deploy a contract. Below the step
is declared the `artifact` configuration which is the name of the target contract.

The `[var.main]` allows Cannon to apply a setting or intermediate value
to a contract. In our example contract we defined a variable `number`:

<Snippet>
 <p>uint256 public number;</p>
</Snippet>

That variable value can be set in the cannonfile with the `[var.main]` step.

And finally in the `[invoke.set_number]`  step we define following settings:

- `target`, name of the contract to call or contract operation.
- `func`, name of the function to call on the contract.
- `args`, this determines the arguments to use when invoking the call (optional).

See how the  `<%= settings.number %>`  string template refers to the `number`
var in the `[var.main]` step.

<Alert variant="info">
 <AlertDescription>
   📢 Some of the cannonfile steps use templates like `args = ["<%= settings.number %>"]` to modify `settings` and `imports` objects.
