## Debugging Tips

Protocol development can often involve frustrating errors that consist of inscrutable bytecode. Function calls staged to a Safe might not be legible. A dreaded `0x` error may be returned from a contract with no reason for the revert to be found.

Cannon can leverage data from packages to decode bytecode, generate human-readable stack traces, and send transactions to protocols.

To use the `decode`, `trace`, and `interact` commands, start by installing/upgrading Cannon:

```bash
npm i -g @usecannon/cli
```

### Decode

You may encounter a hex string related to a protocol, but can't tell what it is. Centralized services such as [ABI Tools](https://openchain.xyz/tools/abi) or the [Ethereum Signature Database](https://www.4byte.directory/) may be able to help, but won't be useful during protocol development or if the relevant ABI hasn't been uploaded there.

You can pass hex data to Cannon's `decode` command, along with the package name and a relevant chain ID, to get a human-readable version of function calls, function output, event data, and error data.

For example, the following command decodes error data:

```bash
cannon decode synthetix-omnibus --chain-id 84531 --preset competition 0xb87daa32000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000006502188b00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000650218190000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000065021855
```

### Trace

If you'd like to better understand the execution of a transaction—whether or not it resulted in an error—you can use Cannon's `trace` command. This command accepts a transaction hash from a remote network or hex-encoded transaction data (as you might find in a gas estimation error).

The command includes some options that allow you to simulate how a transaction (or transaction data) would execute under different circumstances: `--block-number`, `--to`, `--from`, and `--value`. **Note that you must connect to an archive node (using the `--rpc-url` option) to successfully simulate a call on a historical block.**

For example, the following command provides a full stack trace for retrieving the debt associated with a pool's vault in Synthetix V3:

```bash
cannon trace --chain-id 10 synthetix-omnibus 0x2fb8ff2400000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000010000000000000000000000008700daec35af8ff88c16bdf0418774cb3d7599b4 --to 0xffffffaEff0B96Ea8e4f94b2253f31abdD875847 --rpc-url https://optimism.publicnode.com
```

### Interact

Similar to the [interact tab](/packages/synthetix/latest/1-main/interact) in the package explorer, the CLI allows you to call view functions and send transactions to protocols in the command-line interface.

For example, you can use the interact tool to call functions on Synthetix V3:

```bash
cannon interact synthetix --chain-id 1 --rpc-url https://ethereum.publicnode.com
```

If you'd like to send transactions, you can use [Frame](https://frame.sh/) or include a private key using either an environment variable `CANNON_PRIVATE_KEY` or the `--private-key` option.

For more information on the command-line interact command, see the [CLI section of the documentation](/learn/cli).
