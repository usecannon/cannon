## Set up Your Dev Environment
**Cannon** is a DevOps tool for protocols on Ethereum. It manages protocol and smart contract deployments for local development and live networks, replacing deploy scripts with [Cannonfiles](https://usecannon.com/learn/cannonfile).

#### Installing Foundry

<Alert variant="info">

</Alert>

**Cannon** is built on [Foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/) (though it is also compatible with Hardhat.)

In your terminal, run

```bash
curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash
```
This installs the `foundryup` command, which can be run again later to upgrade Foundry to its latest version.

#### Installing Cannon CLI

Cannon’s **command-line interface** (CLI) allows users to deploy, upgrade, and configure protocols using Cannonfiles with the `build` command, `publish` the resulting packages, `run` packages locally, and more. Find the code for the CLI [on GitHub](https://github.com/usecannon/cannon/tree/main/packages/cli).

Run one of the following commands in your terminal to install Cannon. You can run it again later to upgrade to the latest version.
