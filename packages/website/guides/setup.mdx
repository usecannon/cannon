## Set up Your Dev Environment

Cannon is a powerful developer tool designed to streamline the process of building and deploying blockchain applications on the Ethereum network. It simplifies the management of smart contracts and protocols, making development more efficient and organized. 

Essentially, Cannon acts as a DevOps tool for protocols on Ethereum. It manages protocol and smart contract deployments for local development and live networks, replacing deploy scripts with [Cannonfiles](https://usecannon.com/learn/cannonfile).

### Step 1: Install Foundry

<Alert variant="info">

</Alert>

Cannon is built on [Foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/) (though it is also compatible with Hardhat).

1. Open your terminal.
2. To install Foundry, execute the following command, which installs the `foundryup` command that can be run again later to upgrade Foundry to its latest version:

   ```bash
   curl -L [https://foundry.paradigm.xyz](https://foundry.paradigm.xyz) | bash
   ```

3. To confirm that Foundry is installed correctly, run the following command in your terminal:

   ```bash
   foundry --version
   ```

### Step 2: Install Cannon CLI

Cannonâ€™s **command-line interface** (CLI) allows users to deploy, upgrade, and configure protocols using Cannonfiles with the `build` command, `publish` the resulting packages, `run` packages locally, and more. Find the code for the CLI [on GitHub](https://github.com/usecannon/cannon/tree/main/packages/cli).

1. Open your terminal.
2. To install Cannon, execute one of the following commands in your terminal based on your preferred package manager. These commands can also be used later to upgrade to the latest version.

3. Run `cannon --version` to confirm that your installation or upgrade succeeded.

   ```bash
   cannon --version
   ```
