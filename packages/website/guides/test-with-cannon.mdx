## Test with Cannon

By convention, tests in Foundry are located in the `/test` folder and the test files have `test` in their name, although `.t.sol` is usually used as the extension.

  <AlertDescription>
    For more information on how to write and perform tests with Foundry, [review their docs](https://book.getfoundry.sh/forge/tests).

In this example, we will use the test created by `forge init` in `test/Counter.t.sol`.

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: UNLICENSED
pragma solidity ^0.8.13;

import { Test } from "forge-std/Test.sol";
import { Counter } from "../src/Counter.sol";

contract CounterTest is Test {
    Counter public counter;
    
    Counter counter

    function setUp() public {
        counter = new Counter();
        counter.setNumber(0);
    }

    function test_Increment() public {
        counter.increment();
        assertEq(counter.number(), 1);
    }

    function testFuzz_SetNumber(uint256 x) public {
        counter.setNumber(x);
        assertEq(counter.number(), x);
    }
}
```

We are going to use the `cannon-std` helper library from Cannon to write tests. This library allows us to access data from the build. To install it, run:

```bash
forge install usecannon/cannon-std
```

Cannon runs `forge test` in the background, but the `cannon test` command can receive a specific cannonfile as an argument to run the test suites. By default, it uses `cannonfile.toml`.

<Alert variant="warning">
  <AlertDescription>
    This is a simple case of testing using `cannon test`. Later, we'll see how we can use `usecannon/cannon-std` to interact with the Cannon registry and other contracts deployed in Cannon.

After running the tests, the CLI will notify us that all tests have passed successfully.
