# Cannon | Foundry Artifacts Example

Example showing how to import external artifacts from a foundry project.

### Getting Started

First, make sure to have cannon installed:

```bash
npm i -g @usecannon/cli
```

Then, you can build locally the cannonfile just running:

```bash
cannon build
```

Or, deploy it to a live network, like so:

```bash
cannon build --chain-id 10 --private-key <0xPRIVATE_KEY>
```
