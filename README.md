# Cannon

This is the monorepo for Cannon. If you're just interested in using the project, [visit the website](https://usecannon.com).

**⚠️ Cannon is under active development. While the interface and functionality are generally stable, use the tool with caution when conducting high-risk deployments.**

For more information, please see documentation in the modules listed below:

- [`cli`](packages/cli): The command-line interface. Run `npx @usecannon/cli --help` for usage information.
- [`builder`](packages/builder): Builds chain data from cannonfiles. (This is used by the CLI.)
- [`hardhat-cannon`](packages/hardhat-cannon): Code for the Hardhat plug-in, which wraps the CLI functionality with defaults pulled from a Hardhat project configuration.
- [`registry`](packages/registry): The smart contract for the package registry.
- [`registry-subgraph`](packages/registry-subgraph): Indexes the registry contract onto The Graph for display on the website.
- [`website`](packages/website): The website, hosted at https://usecannon.com

Usage Examples:

- [`router-architecture`](examples/router-architecture): Project demonstrating how to setup an upgradable [Router Architecture](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@synthetixio/router).
- [`sample-hardhat-project`](examples/sample-hardhat-project): Hardhat project that demonstrates the core functionality of the `hardhat-cannon` module
- [`sample-foundry-project`](examples/sample-hardhat-project): Foundry project that demonstrates the core functionality of the `cli` module

## Development

### Contribution Guidelines

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md)

### Version and Publish
We use [changesets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets) to manage versions on our monorepo.

Currently our [release workflow](.github/workflows/release.yml) on our CI handles bumping package versions and publishing releases to npm through lerna.
It only publishes releases if any changeset PR's have been added to the commit history merged into main.

To trigger a new version bump run the following command (from the root of the repo):
``` 
  npm run changeset
```

If a situation where a commit was merged without a changeset, we can always bump and publish manually using lerna's [version and publish](https://lerna.js.org/docs/features/version-and-publish) workflow:

`npx lerna publish --no-private` will bump package versions and find npm packages that need to be published in the repo.
